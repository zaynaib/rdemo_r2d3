# README

This repo contains demos the **D3 for R Users** workshop.

The [r2d3](https://rstudio.github.io/r2d3/) is an R package that allows you to embed D3 visualizations inside of your R workflow. You can put D3.js visualizations inside your R markdownd reports, shiny applications, R notebooks, etc. 

It does this by import data from R into D3.js scripts. In order to use this package you will need to understand the fundamentals of D3.js.  D3.js has a steep learning curve on its own. Ideally you will have an understanding of web fundamentals i.e. HTML, CSS, and beginner level JavaScript. Since r2d3 package allows RStudio to be a web serve it means you can focus on learning the [D3.js API](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/main/API.md).

I've provided a list of resources and examples of me using the r2d3 package in this repo.
