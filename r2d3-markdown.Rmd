## R Markdown and R2D3

You can embed D3 data visualizations in your R Markdown files or R Notebooks.
This can be done by calling the ```r2d3()``` function within an R chunk.

```{r}
library(r2d3)
r2d3(data=c(0.3, 0.6, 0.8, 0.95, 0.40, 0.20), script = "barchart.js")
```
```{r}
library(r2d3)
r2d3(data=c(0.3, 0.6, 0.8, 0.95, 0.40, 0.20), script = "barchart-options.js",options = list(color = "orange"))
```
